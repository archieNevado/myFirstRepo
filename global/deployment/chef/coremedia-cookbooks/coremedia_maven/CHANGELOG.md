coremedia-maven Cookbook CHANGELOG
======================
This file is used to list changes made in each version of the coremdia-maven cookbook.

v.2.0.4
------
- create parent dir of artifact only if it does not exist.

v.2.0.3
------
- make `nexus_url` robust when trailing slash is missing.

v.2.0.2
------
- by using the attributes `nexus_url` and `nexus_repo` artifacts can now be resolved using metaversions like `RELEASE`, `LATEST` and
the standard `-SNAPSHOT` semantic. If both `nexus_repo` and `repository_url` are defined, nexus rest will be preferred.

v2.0.0
-------
- artifacts are no longer cached twice, if its a remote source a HEAD request is made and`If-Modified-Since` header is checked.
If its a local `file://` url, file checked locally and copied directly.
- attribute `extract_force_clean` added. Set this to true to delete the target dir before the extraction. Defaults to `false`.

### Breaking Changes
- Attribute `force_download` has been removed.

v1.0.3
-------
- fix eviction of versions cache and disable it by default.
- add parameter `backup` to set the number of chef cache backups to keep.
- use powershell_script resource to unzip on windows. This removes the windows cookbook dependency.

v1.0.2
-------
- add trailing slash to repository url if missing
- change cache path to `#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/maven-repo` for easier vagrant-cachier integration

v1.0.1

v1.0.0
-------
- refactor cookbook into a pure library cookbook
- LWRP attribute `packaging` defaults now automatically to the file extension of the target path.

#### Breaking Changes
