Solr Master Slave Replication
=============================

To enable Solr master / slave replication, all you need to do is add
another solr container service and set some environment variables.

* `SOLR_MASTER` - set this to `false` on the slave
* `SOLR_SLAVE` - set this to `true` on the slave
* `SOLR_MASTER_URL` - set this to the solr master url or keep it empty if
  started with the default docker slave setup.
* `SOLR_SLAVE_AUTOCREATE_CORES` - set this to `true` to automatically
  create the cores for the slave.
* `SOLR_SLAVE_AUTOCREATE_CORES_LIST` - set this to a space separated list of core names to control
  which cores should be replicated by this slave
* `SOLR_SLAVE_AUTOCREATE_THRESHOLD` - set this to a numerical value to wait for at least that number of cores
  to be available before creating all found cores and start solr. This is only
  effective if `SOLR_SLAVE_AUTOCREATE_CORES_LIST` is empty.

In the Docker compose setup simply add the following service definition:

```yaml
  solr-slave:
    image: ${REPOSITORY_PREFIX:-coremedia}/solr
    networks:
      - backend
    restart: always
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "5m"
        max-file: "3"
    environment:
      SOLR_MASTER: "false"
      SOLR_SLAVE: "true"
      SOLR_SLAVE_AUTOCREATE_CORES: "true"
      SOLR_SLAVE_AUTOCREATE_CORES_LIST: "preview studio"
```

Now all you need is to configure the slave in your consuming services:
* `cae-preview`
* `cae-live`
* `studio-server`

You can achieve this by overwriting the corresponding systemproperties
using environment variables, i.e.:

```yaml
  cae-preview:
    environment:
      ELASTIC_SOLR_URL: http://solr-slave:8983/solr
      SOLR_URL: http://solr-slave:8983/solr
```

Scaling the solr slaves in Docker compose
-----------------------------------------

If you use Docker compose, there is a load balancing built in by default.
You can define network aliases and multiple services can share the same alias.
The load balancing will be a round robin dispatching from the alias
to one of the containers with that alias.
To configure this, simply add a network alias in the `solr-slave` service.

In the `solr-slave` definition add the following labels:
```yaml
  solr-slave:
    networks:
      backend:
        aliases:
          - solr-slave
```

Then you can start up the compose stack with the scale option, i.e.:

`docker compose up --scale solr-slave=3 -d` to scale three solr-slaves.
