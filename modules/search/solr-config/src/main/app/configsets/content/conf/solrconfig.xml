       for better NRT performance.

  <!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
       index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
       A "compressionMode" string element can be added to <codecFactory> to choose
       between the existing compression modes in the default codec: "BEST_SPEED" (default)
       or "BEST_COMPRESSION".

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified, Solr will load the schema from
       he resource named in 'managedSchemaResourceName', rather than from schema.xml.
       Note that the managed schema resource CANNOT be named schema.xml.  If the managed
       schema does not exist, Solr will create it after reading schema.xml, then rename
       'schema.xml' to 'schema.xml.bak'.

       Do NOT hand edit the managed schema - external modifications will be ignored and
       overwritten as a result of schema modification REST API calls.

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified with mutable = true, schema
       modification REST API calls will be allowed; otherwise, error responses will be
       sent back for these requests.

         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For

  <!-- Search Components

       Search components are registered to SolrCore and used by
       instances of SearchHandler (which can access them by name)

       By default, the following components are available:

       <searchComponent name="query"     class="solr.QueryComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="facet"     class="solr.FacetComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="mlt"       class="solr.MoreLikeThisComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="highlight" class="solr.HighlightComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="stats"     class="solr.StatsComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="debug"     class="solr.DebugComponent" />

       Default configuration in a requestHandler would look like:

       <arr name="components">
         <str>query</str>
         <str>facet</str>
         <str>mlt</str>
         <str>highlight</str>
         <str>stats</str>
         <str>debug</str>
       </arr>

       If you register a searchComponent to one of the standard names,
       that will be used instead of the default.

       To insert components before or after the 'standard' components, use:

       <arr name="first-components">
         <str>myFirstComponentName</str>
       </arr>

       <arr name="last-components">
         <str>myLastComponentName</str>
       </arr>

       NOTE: The component registered with the name "debug" will
       always be executed after the "last-components"
